# RemoteRDP  
This application was developed for myself. It monitors RDP connections to a remote computer.   
It is a desktop application that uses a MongoDB database, which stores information about user connections to a remote machine and controls access to that machine. Access control is regulated by an entry in the lock collection table, which stores data about the current connection.
